The Countdown Timer is a captivating visualization of the passage of time. LEDs "rain" down the matrix once the timer is started. As the timer runs, drops start to pool - i.e. an LED is left on - and time is up once matrix is full. The timer is set by speaking the number of minutes into a mobile phone. The core components of the project are an Arduino Uno, an neopixel 8x8 RGB LED matrix, a Bluetooth module, and a Windows Phone 10 running the Windows Virtual Shields for Arduino app. A full description of the project along with a parts list and assembly instructions can be found at https://www.hackster.io/peejster/countdown-timer
